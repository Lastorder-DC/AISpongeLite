# AI Sponge Lite

## About

AI Sponge Lite is a Discord bot that generates audio-only AI Sponge episodes with transcripts. The episodes generated
are mostly inspired by the original AI Sponge with a little inspiration from AI Sponge Rehydrated.

## Usage

This bot adds the `/generate` command, which takes a topic as an argument. The bot will then generate the episode,
providing status updates as it does. If generation completes successfully, the user will be put on a 30-minute cooldown
to allow other users a chance to use the bot. Only one episode can be generated at a time.

## Demonstration

## Disclaimer

This bot is not affiliated with AI Sponge Rehydrated. This bot also falls under fair use since it is a parody of
SpongeBob SquarePants.
