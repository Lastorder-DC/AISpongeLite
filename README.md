# AI Sponge Lite

## About

AI Sponge Lite is a Discord bot that generates audio-only AI Sponge episodes with transcripts. It exists due to my
liking of AI Sponge and its inner workings. I wanted to try to make a similar project for the fun of it.

## Usage

This bot adds the `/generate` command, which takes a topic as an argument. The bot will then generate the episode,
providing status updates as it does. If generation completes successfully, the user will be put on a 30-minute cooldown
to allow other users a chance to use the bot. Only one episode can be generated at a time.

## Demonstration

<div align="center">
    <img src="img/generating.png" alt="Generating" title="Generating" width="40%" /> <img src="img/error.png" alt="Error" title="Error" width="40%" />
    <img src="img/cooldown.png" alt="Cooldown" title="Cooldown" width="40%" /> <img src="img/busy.png" alt="Busy" title="Busy" width="40% "/>
    <img src="img/output.png" alt="Output" title="Output" />
</div>

## Disclaimer

This bot is not affiliated with AI Sponge Rehydrated. This bot also falls under fair use since it is a parody of
SpongeBob SquarePants.
