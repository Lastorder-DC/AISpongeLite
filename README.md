## About

AI Sponge Lite is a Discord bot that generates parody AI Sponge audio episodes, chats, and TTS inspired by 
[AI Sponge Rehydrated](https://aisponge.riskivr.com/).

Available characters include SpongeBob, Patrick, Squidward, Gary, Sandy, Mr. Krabs, Plankton, Karen, Mrs. Puff, 
Squilliam, Larry, Bubble Bass, Bubble Buddy, DoodleBob, and French Narrator. Some characters will sound different from 
Rehydrated due to them using local models. There are also many character alts that can only appear in episodes when 
mentioned in topics, which are up to you to discover!

## Usage

### Slash Commands

- `/episode`: Generate an episode. Only one episode can be generated at a time globally. There is a 10-minute cooldown
  upon successful generation, unless you purchase the
  ["Remove Cooldown" subscription ($1.99/Mo)](https://discord.com/discovery/applications/1254296070599610469/store/1343274119084638239).
- `/chat`: Chat with a character. You can only generate one chat at a time. There is no cooldown.
- `/tts`: Synthesize character speech. You can only generate one TTS at a time. TTS generation is unavailable while an 
  episode is generating. There is no cooldown.
- `/stats`: Show bot statistics. See how many generations have been completed in the last 24 hours and for all
  time, as well as the number of servers the bot is in, API latency, and uptime.
- `/help`: Show bot help. This will show a link to the Discord App Directory.

### Context Menu Commands

- `Convert OGG to MP3`: Convert episode or TTS output in OGG format to MP3. Useful for devices that do not support OGG 
  format.
