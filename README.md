# AI Sponge Lite

## About

AI Sponge Lite is a Discord bot that generates audio-only AI Sponge episodes with transcripts. The episodes generated
are mostly inspired by the original AI Sponge with a little inspiration from AI Sponge Rehydrated.

## Usage

This bot adds two commands:

- `/generate <topic>`: Generates an episode with the given topic. Only one episode can be generated at a time globally.
  Upon successful generation, the user who ran the command will be put on a 30-minute cooldown. Since this is AI
  Sponge "Lite", not everything is available from other versions of AI Sponge. Worth noting is the list of available
  characters:
    - SpongeBob
    - Patrick
    - Squidward (can be referred to as Loudward)
    - Gary
    - Sandy
    - Mr. Krabs
    - Plankton
    - Karen
    - Mrs. Puff
- `/status`: Checks whether a new episode can be generated at the time the user sent the command.

## Notice

- No instructions for setting up this project will be provided, as my intent is that you add the public bot to your
  servers.
- This bot is not affiliated with the official AI Sponge Rehydrated.
- This project is considered fair use since it is a parody of SpongeBob SquarePants.
